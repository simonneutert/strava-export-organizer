# Strava Export Organizer

The purpose of this project is to organize your activities data in your Strava export.

After running this tool you should have your activity files sorted by the type of activity and the year it was performed in. 

The script will create a directory tree like this:

```text
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeA>/<:activity_typeA>_<:year1>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeA>/<:activity_typeA>_<:year2>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeB>/<:activity_typeB>_<:year3>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeC>/<:activity_typeC>_<:year1>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeC>/<:activity_typeC>_<:year2>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeC>/<:activity_typeC>_<:year3>/
./export_mapped/<:activity_typeC>/<:activity_typeD>_<:year2>/
# and so on...
```
